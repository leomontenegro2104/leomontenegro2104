# Hi, I’m Leonardo — Software Engineer

Software Engineer with an **MBA in Full Cycle Architecture**, **7+ years** of Mechanical Engineering background, and **3+ years** building modern web applications with **ReactJS, Python, and NodeJS**. I bridge engineering rigor with product thinking to deliver scalable, maintainable, and user-focused software across **front-end, back-end, and full-stack**.

I’ve led projects, optimized complex systems, and shipped **scalable web solutions** using **React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Python (Flask/FastAPI)**, aligning technology with business goals. Beyond coding, I care about **architecture, DX, performance, and clean processes**—managing work, guiding teams, and streamlining delivery for consistent, high-impact results.

Currently focused on **robust, scalable, and user-centric** products. Comfortable on **AWS** and **GCP**, and happy to contribute as **Front-End**, **Back-End**, or **Full-Stack**—always with an eye on **performance, usability, and innovation**.
